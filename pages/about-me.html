                Aloha, I’m Clint! I’m a designer with a passion for business and serving users. Especially start-ups, or businesses that promote positive social value. Growing up in a household of 12 kids and my parents tackling handling a restaurant, hard work, creativity, and collaboration was a natural strength. Taking that and mixing it with my education as a web developer and web designer, I love creating meaningful designs and creating meaningful and impactful websites. 
                <br><br>
                Being mostly self-taught, I worked for a small SaaS company and took what I learned from there to various SEO agencies inserting myself as a web designer. Moving away from marketing and into development, I was a unique blend of SEO, design, and development. I currently build online courses for thousands of students at Pima Community College. 
                <br><br>
                After designing over 50+ websites, I’ve learned to see each piece of work as a process of refinement. That everything can and should be in a state of transformation and growth. Being able to see that growth in me and turning ugly outdated websites into something modern and functional feeds something internal and eternal in me as a designer.
